This is the second Game i worked on as a part of my study Creative Media and Game technologies, it has been made in a custom engine made by teachers called the GXPEngine.
The game is an infinitely generating jetpack game where you have to get a high score, and it was made with a custom controller.
The code was made by Ryan Bleeker and myself.
